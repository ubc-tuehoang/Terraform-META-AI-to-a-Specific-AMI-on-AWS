## This Terraform script simplifies the launch of an EC2 instance with OLLAMA, running the latest META model Llama3 within a restricted and unique AMI image.


### The advantages of using a unique and restricted AMI include:

- Enhanced Security: Unique AMIs are tailored to specific requirements, reducing the attack surface and mitigating security risks associated with using standardized or publicly available AMIs.

- Custom Configuration: Restricted AMIs can be pre-configured with specific software, settings, and security measures to meet organizational or regulatory compliance requirements, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.

- Isolation of Environments: By using a unique AMI, organizations can isolate their environments from potential vulnerabilities or dependencies introduced by other users or third-party sources, enhancing overall system stability and reliability.

- Controlled Access: Restricted AMIs limit access to authorized users or groups, preventing unauthorized modifications or deployments and maintaining the integrity of the underlying infrastructure.

- Simplified Compliance: Unique and restricted AMIs facilitate compliance efforts by providing a known and auditable baseline configuration, making it easier to track changes, enforce policies, and demonstrate regulatory compliance to auditors or stakeholders.
